# FoodBoard

FoodBoard is a cross-platform mobile application that automates local food donation systems. It is built with **Flutter** and **Firebase**. This project aims to drive action towards [**SDG 2: Zero Hunger**](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/) and [**SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/). It is one of the **Top 50 semi-finalists** in the **2021 Google Solution Challenge**. FoodBoard was inspired by the massive food waste problem in Metro Manila wherein an estimated 2000 tons of food are thrown away daily. Meanwhile, one in three Filipinos who live below the poverty line continue to struggle with lack of food security.

## Getting Started

Make sure that you have Flutter set up with the respective editor plugins for [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Check the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) for more information.

## Installation
1. Open a simulator. Type `open -a simulator` if you're working on a Mac. Open a virtual device with AVD Manager to test it with an Android emulator.
2. Run `flutter run`.

## Usage

Users can register for Foodboard as a **food donor**, a **food rescuer**, or a **food pantry**. They will need to input addtional information relevant to those specific roles in order to finish creating their account. Users can earn certificates courtesy of [Rise Against Hunger](https://www.riseagainsthunger.org/) and the [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/) after reaching donation milestones.

#### Food Donor

Food donors can help support underpriviledged communities by sending them their excess supplies. They can simply post details of their inventory on FoodBoard and easily connect to third-party organizations who can route their donations to those in need. 

#### Food Rescuer

Food rescuers can volunteer to recover food that would otherwise be wasted and transport them to food banks and other charitable organizations. They can choose among the donations already accepted by food pantries at their convenience.

#### Food Pantry

Food pantries can browse donations posted on FoodBoard and accept them depending on local demand. They can subsequently receive said donations once a food rescuer has successfully delivered it to the designated location.
